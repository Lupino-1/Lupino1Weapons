Custom Weapons Plugin

The Custom Weapons Plugin introduces unique, special weapons for Minecraft that players can obtain through loot crates. Each weapon has a unique ability, activated with an item called Mana, which players must gather through crafting. This plugin is designed to balance pay-to-win mechanics with a grindable resource system, ensuring that players have to work to gather Mana even if they acquire weapons from crates.
Key Features
Special Weapons and Abilities:

        Shadow Dagger: Allows players to teleport up to 60 blocks in the direction they are facing. The total distance is cumulative, so players can teleport multiple times until the sum reaches 60 blocks.
        
        Vampire Blade: Drains health from nearby players within a 7-block radius, healing the user by 1 heart per affected player every second for 10 seconds.
        
        Flaming Axe: Creates a shockwave dealing heavy damage (7.5 hearts within 6 blocks) and moderate damage (5 hearts within 9 blocks).
        
        Cold Staff: Freezes players within a 9-block radius for 5 seconds.
        
        Staff of Healing: Heals the player to full health upon activation.
        
        Shield of Eternity: Knocks back players within a 6-block radius for 10 seconds when active.

Mana System:
        Mana is required to activate weapon abilities, consuming one Mana per use. Mana must be crafted, making it a limited resource that adds strategy to ability usage.

Configurable Settings:
        Customize weapon cooldowns, ability radius, duration, and damage/healing values.
        Enable or disable specific weapons or adjust abilities for different worlds (Overworld, Nether, End).
        Define Safe Zones where weapons have no effect, and Normal PvP zones where weapon use is restricted based on configuration.

World-Based Weapon Limitations:
        Set which worlds (Overworld, Nether, End) allow weapon abilities.
        Define specific safe zones in each dimension to prevent ability effects within defined boundaries.

This plugin provides an immersive PvP experience with configurable options for balancing special abilities, adding strategic depth and customization for server owners.
